== Increase the size of NooBaa’s S3 endpoint.

The Quay Operator creates default object storage using the defaults provided by RHODF operator when creating a NooBaa object (50 Gib). 

To increase the size of the PVs backing NooBaa’s S3 endpoint, you can resize an existing PVC or add more PVCs to a new storage pool. In this exercise, do the former.

. In the OpenShift console, select *Storage → Persistent Volume Claims*.
. Select the PersistentVolumeClaim named like db-noobaa-db-pg-0.
