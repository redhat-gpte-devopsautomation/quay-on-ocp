== Reconfigure Quay via the config editor

=== Disable user creation by non-superuser

You might have noticed that anyone having access to the Registry endpoint would be able to create a new user and start using Red Hat Quay. You will disable this now.

. Assuming that you are already logged into the config editor do the following steps

. To disable user creation by any other user other than super admin by *unticking the checkbox* that says *Enable Non-Superuser User Creation*

=== Change the server hostname

The default hostname of the server is a bit long, shorten it.

. Scroll up to the Server Configuration section and click on `Edit fields` to enable editing

. Shorten the serverhostname by changing it

From

`example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-guid.guid.sandbox2348.opentlc.com`
+
To
+
`quay.apps.cluster-guid.guid.sandbox2348.opentlc.com`

. When you clicked the Reconfigure Quay button in the config editor, a new config was sent to the Red Hat Quay Operator and a updated deploy of application was rolled out by the Operator with this new config. That can be viewed by clicking on the *Config Bundle Secret*

. Scroll down and click on `reveal values`. Notice that the three settings that we changed
.. FEATURE_USER_CREATION: false
.. SERVER_HOSTNAME: quay.apps.cluster-dv82w.dv82w.sandbox2348.opentlc.com
.. SUPER_USERS:
quayadmin

. Navigate to *Networking > Routes* and see that the route has also been updated by the Operator

. We are using the config editor as a graphical interface to generate a config which is actually the config bundle secret. So if you change anything directly in the config bundle secret and save, an updated quay deployment will rollout.
