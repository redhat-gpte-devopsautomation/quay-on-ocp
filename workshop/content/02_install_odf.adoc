The Red Hat Openshift Data Foundation (RHODF) Operator allows to create a standalone instance of Multi-Cloud Object Gateway backed by a local Kubernetes PersistentVolumes.

.. Click on the *OpenShift Data Foundation* operator and then click on the *Install* button
.. Keep the default values and click on the next *Install* button
.. The Operator installs in a namespace called `openshift-storage`
.. Instead of clicking on `Create StorageSystem` click on `View installed Operators in Namespace openshift-storage` to view the newly installed operator.
.. You skipped the StorageSystem creation because you will create NooBaa object storage as outlined in the next page.

NOTE:  As part of a Red Hat Quay subscription, users are entitled to use the Multi-Cloud Object Gateway (MCG) component of the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Operator (formerly known as OpenShift Container Storage Operator).
