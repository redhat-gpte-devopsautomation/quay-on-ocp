== Proxy Caching

Registries like Docker or Google Cloud Platform have rate limitations and throttling on the number of times users can pull from these registries.

Red Hat Quay can act as a proxy cache and has the following benefits:

- Bypass pull-rate limitations from upstream registries. 
- Accelerate pull performance, because images are pulled from the cache rather than upstream dependencies. 
- Cached images are only updated when the upstream image digest differs from the cached image, reducing rate limitations and potential throttling.

. Enable proxy caching by setting the below flag in your config bundle secret
+
[source,sh]
----
FEATURE_PROXY_CACHE: true

. Scroll down and click *Save*. It will take a minute for the changes to take effect.

. Create a new organisation named `proxytest`
.. Enter the Remote registry value: `quay.io``
.. Enter the corresponding Remote registry username and password
.. Expiration is an optional field
.. Click *Save*
+
Once you click Save, you will see a message which says `Successfully created proxy cache configuration`

. Now pull a image
+
[source,sh]
----
podman pull --tls-verify=false quay.apps.cluster-dv82w.dv82w.sandbox2348.opentlc.com/proxytest/projectquay/quay:3.7.9
podman pull --tls-verify=false quay.apps.cluster-dv82w.dv82w.sandbox2348.opentlc.com/proxytest/projectquay/quay:3.6.2
----

. These images are pulled from quay.io but is being cached in the proxytest organization of your quay registry.

. Set a Storage quota of *1 GB* on this *proxytest* organization by logging into the superuser admin panel, and change the quota for the proxytest organization. This process has been described in detail in the previous exercise.

=== Auto prune feature
. Pull the last image that will result in your repository exceeding the the allotted quota, for example:
+
[source,sh]
----
podman pull --tls-verify=false quay.apps.cluster-dv82w.dv82w.sandbox2348.opentlc.com/proxytest/projectquay/quay:3.8.1
----

. Refresh the Tags page of your Red Hat Quay registry. 
.. The first image that you pushed, for example, quay:3.7.9 should have been auto-pruned. 
.. The Tags page should now show quay:3.6.2 and quay:3.8.1.
