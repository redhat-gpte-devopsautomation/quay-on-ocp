== Increase the Postgres database size 

You can easily increase the PVC size for the Postgres database of Quay and Clair. This is called volume size override.
As the storage is managed by the operator, you need edit the custom resource.

. Click on *Installed Operators> Red Hat Quay > Click on QuayRegistry tab > select example-registry*
. Click on Actions dropdown and select `Edit QuayRegistry`
. Add the overrides for the volume size for both the clair and quay databases
