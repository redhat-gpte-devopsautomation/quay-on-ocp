== Custom Clair configuration with a managed database 

Clair uses the following vulnerability databases to scan for issues in your images:

Alpine SecDB database +
AWS UpdateInfo +
Debian Oval database +
Oracle Oval database +
RHEL Oval database +
SUSE Oval database +
Ubuntu Oval database +
Pyup.io (python) database

=== Disable the python updater

The python updater is responsible for continuously downloading the vulnerability database for python. In this exercise you will disable the python updater for Clair, although Clair will still remain `managed` by the Quay operator.

So, as per the upstream clair documentation, the list of matcher names can be found here https://quay.github.io/clair/reference/config.html#matchersnames

alpine +
aws +
debian +
oracle +
photon +
python +
rhel +
suse +
ubuntu +
crda +

. We need to use it as per the configuration reference found in this https://quay.github.io/clair/reference/config.html#configuration-reference[link] here.
We need to include all the matcher except `python` as per this exercise requirement.

. Your final yaml would look like this, copy it:
+
[source,sh]
----
updaters:
  sets:
    - alpine
    - aws
    - debian
    - oracle
    - photon
    - rhel
    - suse
    - ubuntu
----

. Now edit your config bundle secret and add a new key value pair

. The key would be `clair-config.yaml` and the value will include the yaml you copied.

. Click Save

. Now this user provided configuration will be merged with the configuration which is provided by the Operator and new clair-app deployments will be rolled out with the updated configuration.

. You can see the updated configuration by navigating to *Workloads>Deployments>example-registry-clair-app*

. Scroll down to the Volumes section and click on the secret itâ€™s using (refer screenshot). 
Example name is

Notice that your provided settings has been appended to the existing configuration.


Thus, the python updaters for the vulnerability database of clair have been disabled.
