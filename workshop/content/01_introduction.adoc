== Introduction

Red Hat Quay is an enterprise-quality registry for building, securing and serving container images. 
It provides secure storage, distribution, and governance of containers and cloud-native artifacts on any infrastructure.

Manual deployments of Red Hat Quay involves a lot of components and the overhead of managing those components. Red Hat Quay is best deployed on Red Hat OpenShift using the Operators which simplifies the deployment and manages all the components.
