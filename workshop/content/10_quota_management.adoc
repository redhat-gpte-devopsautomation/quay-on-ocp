== Quota Management and consumption tracking

In Red Hat Quay, users have the ability to report storage consumption and to contain registry growth by establishing configured storage quota limits.

. To enable quota management, set the feature flag in your config.yaml to true. You can do this from the OpenShift console UI, by editing the config bundle secret to include the following line and click Save.
